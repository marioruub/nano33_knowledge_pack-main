# nano33_knowledge_pack-main

This repository contains the firmware that the Arduino Nano 33 must have to be able to recognize different strokes in tennis.

This firmware has been developed by [SensiML](https://sensiml.com/) and this is the link to their repository [nano33_knowledge_pack](https://github.com/sensiml/nano33_knowledge_pack) which you can use it as a starting point to add your ML model, before flashing it to your Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
